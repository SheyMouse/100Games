## The 100 Games Project

This project is where I intend to create 100 games in whatever programming language I am learning at the time. 

At the point of writing, I am not sure how this will go. The aim is to start small with the odd text-based word or number game and get bigger as I get better at programming. However, it could just end up being a place to store 100 variances of 

What is your name: 

Hello <name>

But I hope not.



I started this project after I heard about Jennifer Dewalt's excellent 180 websites in 180 days - http://jenniferdewalt.com/

Her github repo for the project is here - https://github.com/jendewalt 

I don't intend to make 100 games in 100 days. However, I feel that although I am learning to code, I am not doing much with my newfound knowledge. I want the 100 Games project to be a place for me to put my newfound knowledge and skills to the test.
